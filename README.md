# TotemPlates_awesome_wotlk

Not finished yet
For the moment it works with default nameplate only for all totems, for all expac (Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK), and support also minions (Water elem, Treant, Gargoyle....)
class icons feature works too

To do :
- add KuiNameplate support
- add TremorPulse integrated to the code (but for the moment the separate addon works with it), and put the timer inside the icon and color it white
- add ElvUI support

Done :
- Rewrited all the code to match with new C_Nameplate API (awesome_wotlk patch) it's lightweight and easier to add other features
- Removed names and added NPCID scan to adapt the addon for all clients
- added an other icon for Venomous Snake instead to have the same one than Viper
- border color with new texture (red for enemy, green for friendly, blue when you mouse over hover it, white when you target it)
- An option to enable health bar with icons
