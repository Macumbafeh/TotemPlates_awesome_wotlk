# TotemPlates_awesome_wotlk

Not finished yet
For the moment it works with default nameplate only for all totems, for all expac (Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK), and support also minions (Water elem, Treant, Gargoyle....)

To do :
- add class icons feature
- add KuiNameplate support
- add TremorPulse integrated to the code

Done :
- Rewrite all the code to match with new C_Nameplate API (awesome_wotlk patch) to make it lightheight and easier to add other features
- Removed names and added NPCID scan to adapt the addon for all client
