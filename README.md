# TotemPlates_awesome_wotlk

Not finished yet
For the moment it works with default nameplate only for all totems, for all expac (Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK), and support also minions (Water elem, Treant, Gargoyle....)
class icons feature works too

To do :
- add KuiNameplate support
- add TremorPulse integrated to the code (but for the moment the separate addon works with it)
- add an option to enable health bar with icons and anchor healthbar to icons
- add ElvUI support
- border color + CreatureType check (Mannen's report)
- add Tidyplates support

Done :
- Rewrited all the code to match with new C_Nameplate API (awesome_wotlk patch) to make it lightheight and easier to add other features
- Removed names and added NPCID scan to adapt the addon for all clients
- added an other icon for Venomous Snake instead to have the same one than Viper
